## Information
raspi-bento runs several benchmark tests to stress your Raspberry Pi hardware all catered by a menu, offering to export your results as a file for later reference.

## Background
I created raspi-bento as I have multiple Raspberry Pi models and wanted an easy way to benchmark them. Based initally heavily on AikonCWD's work with rpi-benchmark.

## Thanks
A thank you to [AikonCWD](https://github.com/aikoncwd) for the work on [rpi-benchmark](https://github.com/aikoncwd/rpi-benchmark) which raspi-bento heavily used as a basis.
