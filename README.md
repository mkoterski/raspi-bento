Copy and paste the following command in your Raspberry Pi console:

     curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkoterski/raspi-bento/master/raspi-bento.sh | sudo bash


## Information
raspi-bento runs several benchmark tests to stress your Raspberry Pi hardware all catered by a menu, offering to export your results as a file for later reference.

## Background
I created raspi-bento as I have multiple Raspberry Pi models and wanted an easy way to benchmark them. Based initally heavily on AikonCWD's work with rpi-benchmark.

## Thanks
AikonCWD for the work on rpi-benchmark which raspi-bento heavily used as a basis
